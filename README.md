# WORK IN PROGRESS

For now, I'm just using this to post links to pages I'm using to develop this, but I'll make this more legis later...


# Links

* [OsmSharp Performance Issue](https://github.com/OsmSharp/core/issues/97#issuecomment-3219001024) - very useful for getting benchmark stats on where we're trying to improve

* [MapBox Osm Pbf Tutorial](https://github.com/mapbox/osmpbf-tutorial) - an incredible resource for understanding how the osm pbf file format works, this is the main way I'm learning what's going on quickly between the protobuf format and the osm data

* [Osm's Pbf Official Format](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/PBF_Format) - While the MapBox is the primary resource on _how_ to do things, this is the resource on what things we should be doing
